# OpenLending
Coding Assignment for OpenLending

For this assignment, I chose to write all of my code in Python since I'm still a Java novice.

The code consists of a test suite OpenLending.py, and two page objects: googlePage.py and openLendingPage.py.

The test steps:
1. Opens google
2. Searches for "Open Lending"
3. Navigates to the OpenLending homepage
4. Navigates to the Resources page
5. Opens all of the blog pages
6. Grabs all of the blog links
7. Verifies there are no duplicates

Thanks!
